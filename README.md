<p> This program is a modified recreation of the famous board game entitled "Snake and Ladders." Assigned to be only played by against one to four computers, this is a luck and turn-based game that has additional features such as including two new object types: The Doggo and The U-Turn. Players take turns until they reach the finish line. </p>

> **WARNING:** This version of the source code is meant to be run for Windows Machines. Some functionalities may not work on other terminal systems such as POSIX and UNIX.
