<p> This program is a modified recreation of the famous board game entitled "Snake and Ladders." Assigned to only be played by one player against 1-4 computers, this game is a luck and turn-based game that incldues extra functionality by adding two new object types, namely: The Doggo and The U-Turn. PLayers take turns until they eventually reach the finish line. </p>

> **WARNING:** This version of the source code is created for Windows Machines. Some functionalities may not work on other terminal systems such as POSIX and UNIX.
